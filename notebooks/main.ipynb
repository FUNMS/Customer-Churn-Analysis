    "##### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "Customer retention is at the heart of most business models in their effort to increase their profit or revenue margin. Presently, most companies leverage machine learning to build classification models to perform churn analysis on their customers. The highly competitive nature of the telecommunications industry makes retaining customers extremely crucial. This project involves accessing and analyzing customer churn data from multiple sources, building a robust classification model, and helping a telecommunication company predict customer churn to improve retention strategies. The objective is to help a telecommunication company understand customer churn and its impact on profitability. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Goal and Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "•    To understand the current customer churn rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "•    To identify factors (such as demographics, usage patterns, etc.) that influence customer churn aiming to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "•    To build a predictive machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company to forecast which customers are likely to churn\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Stakeholders**\n",
    "•\tCompany Executives and Management\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tData Science and Analytics Team\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tCustomer Service and Support Teams\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tMarketing and Sales and Advertisement Teams:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tFinance \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tLegal and Compliance Team\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Key Metrics and Success Criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Accuracy Requirement:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tThis model must achieve an accuracy score of at least 85% when evaluated on balanced data, ensuring a high proportion of correct predictions.\n",
    "•  F1 Score Benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tModels should attain an F1 score greater than 0.80 (80%), indicating a strong balance between precision and recall, which is crucial for handling both false positives and false negatives effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  ROC Curve Standard:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tAn ROC curve with an area under the curve (AUC) of 80% is desired, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize well and maintain a good balance between sensitivity and specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Baseline Models Requirement:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tAt least four different baseline models should be developed to serve as benchmarks. These could include logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors, providing a range of reference points for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Hyperparameter Tuning Condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning will be conducted only on those baseline models that achieve an F1 score above the 0.80 threshold. This ensures that tuning efforts are concentrated on models that show initial promise and meet the performance criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Null Hypothesis (Ho): There is a significant difference in churn rates between customers who have received promotional offers and those who have not.\n",
    "\n",
    " •Alternate Hypothesis (Ha) : Customers who have not received any promotional offers in the past year have a higher churn rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Analytical Questions**\n",
    "I.\tWhat are the key demographic and behavioral characteristics of customers who churn compared to those who stay, and how do these characteristics vary across different customer segments?\n",
    "\n",
    "II.\tWhat are the financial implications of churn, and how can retention strategies be optimized to maximize customer lifetime value (CLV) across different customer segments?\n",
    "\n",
    "III.\tWhich factors have the highest influence on customer churn, and how do they interact with each other?\n",
    "\n",
    "IV.\tHow do external factors such as economic conditions, competitor actions, and market trends influence customer churn rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "V.\tIs there a correlation between the customer’s payment method and churn rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Scope and Constraints**\n",
    "Some constraints of this project include, computational resources, model complexity, time limitations, stakeholder expectations, and ethical and legal considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Additional Information**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is to be completed in 4 weeks \n",
