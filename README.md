# Customer-Churn-Analysis
Customers are the lifeblood of every business, driving profits and revenue growth. In today's data-driven world, the use of machine learning has become indispensable for businesses aiming to analyze customer behavior and predict potential churn. The highly competitive nature of the telecommunications industry makes retaining customers extremely crucial. This project involves accessing and analyzing customer churn data from multiple sources, building a robust classification model, and helping a telecommunication company predict customer churn to improve retention strategies. The objective is to help a telecommunication company understand customer churn and its impact on profitability. Specifically, the team wants to help the client (telecommunication company) predict if a customer will churn or not and identify factors influencing the churn.

##### **Problem Statement**
Customer retention is at the heart of most business models in their effort to increase their profit or revenue margin. Presently, most companies leverage machine learning to build classification models to perform churn analysis on their customers. The highly competitive nature of the telecommunications industry makes retaining customers extremely crucial. This project involves accessing and analyzing customer churn data from multiple sources, building a robust classification model, and helping a telecommunication company predict customer churn to improve retention strategies. The objective is to help a telecommunication company understand customer churn and its impact on profitability. 

##### **Goal and Objectives**

•    To understand the current customer churn rate.

•    To identify factors (such as demographics, usage patterns, etc.) that influence customer churn aiming to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior

•    To build a predictive machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company to forecast which customers are likely to churn

##### **Stakeholders**
•	Company Executives and Management

•	Data Science and Analytics Team

•	Customer Service and Support Teams

•	Marketing and Sales and Advertisement Teams:

•	Finance 

•	Legal and Compliance Team

##### **Key Metrics and Success Criteria**

•  Accuracy Requirement:

•	This model must achieve an accuracy score of at least 85% when evaluated on balanced data, ensuring a high proportion of correct predictions.
•  F1 Score Benchmark

•	Models should attain an F1 score greater than 0.80 (80%), indicating a strong balance between precision and recall, which is crucial for handling both false positives and false negatives effectively.

•  ROC Curve Standard:

•	An ROC curve with an area under the curve (AUC) of 80% is desired, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize well and maintain a good balance between sensitivity and specificity.

•  Baseline Models Requirement:

•	At least four different baseline models should be developed to serve as benchmarks. These could include logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors, providing a range of reference points for comparison.

•  Hyperparameter Tuning Condition:

Hyperparameter tuning will be conducted only on those baseline models that achieve an F1 score above the 0.80 threshold. This ensures that tuning efforts are concentrated on models that show initial promise and meet the performance criteria.


##### **Hypothesis**

•  Null Hypothesis (Ho): There is a significant difference in churn rates between customers who have received promotional offers.

 •Alternate Hypothesis (Ha) : There is no significant difference in churn rates between customers who have recieved promotional offers




##### **Analytical Questions**
I.	What are the key demographic and behavioral characteristics of customers who churn compared to those who stay?

Insights derrived can include whether certain age groups or regions are more prone to churn, or if specific behaviors (like low usage or frequent complaints) correlate with higher churn rates. 

II.	Is there a relationship between the payment methods used by customers and their likelihood to churn?

Insights include identifying the payment methods used by customers and their likelihood to churn.

III. Is there a difference in customer churn based on the type of internet service they use compared to other factors?

Insights include identifying the most important factors like service quality, pricing competitiveness that contribute to churn, and how they interact with each other.

IV What is the proportion of cusotmers who have churned to those who have not?

Insights include understanding the impact of economic conditions, competitor actions, and market trends on customer churn rates.

V.	What is the overall churn rate compared across different contract types?

Insights include understanding the overall churn rate across different contract types.

vi How do churn rates vary between customers using DSL, Fiber Optic, or no internet service?

How does the length of time a customer has been with the company (tenure) impact their likelihood of churning? Are newer customers more likely to churn than long-term customers?"
